# The 19th Hole
This is my first project as a student in the Get Coding program. I'm an avid golfer and really enjoy watching the game and following the PGA Tour. I plan to have a golf handicap calculator implemented in the application, which is helpful when playing with friends to even the playing field. I will also have games you can play on the course with your buddies and live updates from ongoing PGA tournaments.
