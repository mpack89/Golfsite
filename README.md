# The 19th Hole
This is my first project as a student in the Get Coding program. I'm an avid golfer and really enjoy watching the game and following the PGA Tour. The site I've created has a personal handicap calculator,
a virtual scorecard, a live leaderboard of world golf rankings and a golf trivia game for a bit of fun.

You can visit the live site here ---> [mpack89.github.io](https://mpack89.github.io/)

You can also watch a tutorial/brief description video here ---> https://www.loom.com/share/5c3dddbab5d6419187163161536cd097?sid=32d51d5a-b11e-4b57-9b7b-35aac209cb8e

The 19th Hole was built using:

- Javascript
- Html
- CSS
- Live Leaderboard uses an API from rapidapi.com

Usage:
  
  There is a description on the site for use of the Handicap Calculator, but basically it works by taking your best scores out of your last few rounds and finding the average of said scores.
  The Virtual scorecard has local storage added, so in the event your phone refereshes you will be able to get your card back for the current round by pressing the 'Restore Card' button.
  The Virtual scorecard also contains a 'Reset Card' button which will reset the current card and clear the local storage as well.
  The Live Leaderboard contains the World golf rankings and is not a FedEx cup point leaderboard, so it will differ from the FedEx Cup leaderboard because the scoring includes a larger
  variety of tournaments then just those under the FedEx cup qualifications.
