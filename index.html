    <h1>Welcome to the 19th Hole!</h1>

    <p>The 19th Hole is a site for golf enthusiast. It was created by Mike Pack, an avid golfer and huge fan of the
        game. On this site you will be able to get your personal handicap
        calculated, view online leaderboards and rankings from the PGA Tour, learn some fun facts about golf, and also
        view some golf games you can play on the course with your
        group of friends.</p>

    <h2> Golf Handicap - What is it? What are it's uses? How is it Calculated?</h2>

    <p>A golf handicap is a number assigned to a golfer that accurately reflects that golfer's skill level, reflecting
        the approximate number
        of strokes a golfer is able to shoot in relation to even par. The lower the handicap, the better the golfer, and
        vice versa. In amateur tournament play a golfer is
        grouped into divisions. Group A (0-5), B (5-10), C (10-18). This ensures the competition is fair and exciting
        because you will be playing against people of similar skill level.
        The great thing about knowing your handicap even as someone who plays as a hobby is that it can help even the
        playing field when playing with friends. For example, if you
        are someone who plays a few times a week and have a friend who only gets out on the weekends, you can use the
        handicap to adjust your strokes each hole and keep the friendly
        competition actually competitive, whereas playing straight up stroke for stroke the lesser skilled player will
        have no chance of winning bragging rights.

        WOLF
        Once you decide on a monetary value for each point, and a permanent hitting rotation, you’re ready to play. The
        hitting order will rotate each hole, so if the order is A-B-C-D on the first hole, it’ll be B-C-D-A on the
        second, C-D-A-B on the third, and so on. Once you get to the 17th hole, each person will have been the Wolf four
        times, and you can either let the person with the lowest point total on the 17th and 18th tee be the Wolf, or
        give the A and B one extra turn.

        The Wolf is the first player to tee off on every hole, regardless of the traditional honors system. After
        hitting their tee shot, the Wolf will watch the second player in the group tee off and must decide before the
        third player tees off whether or not to select the second player as their teammate for the hole. Should the Wolf
        choose to forego the second player, he or she again must decide whether or not to select the third player before
        the final player in the foursome tees off. You get the idea.

        Each hole is worth one point per player and best-ball (four ball) scoring is used to determine the winning team
        on each hole. The team’s score is the lowest net score of either team member on the hole. The team with the
        lower score wins the hole, and each team member gets one point. In the event of a tie, no points are awarded for
        the hole, and there are no carryovers in Wolf.

        Scoring- 2 vs 2 = 1 pt per player on winning teammate.
        1 vs 3 = 3 pts for the lone wolf (single player), 1 pt for each player in threesome.




        BINGO BANGO BONGO
        The first player to hit his or her shot onto the green gets a point (Bingo!),
        the player whose ball is closest to the pin when all balls are on the green gets a point (Bango!),
        and the first person to hole out gets a point (Bongo!).At the end of the round whomever has the most points
        wins.
        Can be played with two, three, or four golfers.

        BEST BALL
        A Best Ball match is just that, and can be combined to any number of other team matchups on the course.
        Teams of two play straight up, but as the name suggests, the ‘best’ score on the hole counts as the team score.

        SCRAMBLE
        A scramble in golf has members of a foursome competing as a team against all other teams in the field. Each
        golfer hits his own ball throughout the round but does not necessarily hit subsequent shots from where his ball
        has come to rest. Rather, the ball best hit by the group will determine the location from where everybody will
        hit next, and so on. Only one ball – and thus one score – counts per hole for each team and the team with the
        lowest total score for the round wins.
