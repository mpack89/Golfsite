        <h2>Golf Handicap - What is it? What are it's uses?</h2>

        <p>
          A golf handicap is a number assigned to a golfer that accurately
          reflects that golfer's skill level, reflecting the approximate number
          of strokes a golfer is able to shoot in relation to even par. The
          lower the handicap, the better the golfer, and vice versa. In amateur
          tournament play a golfer is grouped into divisions. Group A (0-5), B
          (5-10), C (10-18). This ensures the competition is fair and exciting
          because you will be playing against people of similar skill level. The
          great thing about knowing your handicap even as someone who plays as a
          hobby is that it can help even the playing field when playing with
          friends. For example, if you are someone who plays a few times a week
          and have a friend who only gets out on the weekends, you can use the
          handicap to adjust your strokes each hole and keep the friendly
          competition actually competitive, whereas playing straight up stroke
          for stroke the lesser skilled player will have no chance of winning
          bragging rights.

        <h4>Golf Games To Play With Friends!</h4>

        <h5>WOLF</h5>

        <p>
          Once you decide on a monetary value for each point, and a permanent
          hitting rotation, you’re ready to play. The hitting order will rotate
          each hole, so if the order is A-B-C-D on the first hole, it’ll be
          B-C-D-A on the second, C-D-A-B on the third, and so on. Once you get
          to the 17th hole, each person will have been the Wolf four times, and
          you can either let the person with the lowest point total on the 17th
          and 18th tee be the Wolf, or give the A and B one extra turn. The Wolf
          is the first player to tee off on every hole, regardless of the
          traditional honors system. After hitting their tee shot, the Wolf will
          watch the second player in the group tee off and must decide before
          the third player tees off whether or not to select the second player
          as their teammate for the hole. Should the Wolf choose to forego the
          second player, he or she again must decide whether or not to select
          the third player before the final player in the foursome tees off. You
          get the idea. Each hole is worth one point per player and best-ball
          (four ball) scoring is used to determine the winning team on each
          hole. The team’s score is the lowest net score of either team member
          on the hole. The team with the lower score wins the hole, and each
          team member gets one point. In the event of a tie, no points are
          awarded for the hole, and there are no carryovers in Wolf. Scoring- 2
          vs 2 = 1 pt per player on winning teammate. 1 vs 3 = 3 pts for the
          lone wolf (single player), 1 pt for each player in threesome.
        </p>

        <h5>BINGO BANGO BONGO</h5>

        <p>
          The first player to hit his or her shot onto the green gets a point
          (Bingo!), the player whose ball is closest to the pin when all balls
          are on the green gets a point (Bango!), and the first person to hole
          out gets a point (Bongo!).At the end of the round whomever has the
          most points wins. Can be played with two, three, or four golfers.
        </p>

        <h5>BEST BALL</h5>

        <p>
          A Best Ball match is just that, and can be combined to any number of
          other team matchups on the course. Teams of two play straight up, but
          as the name suggests, the best score on the hole counts as the team
          score.
        </p>

        <h5>SCRAMBLE</h5>

        <p>
          A scramble in golf has members of a foursome competing as a team
          against all other teams in the field. Each golfer hits his own ball
          throughout the round but does not necessarily hit subsequent shots
          from where his ball has come to rest. Rather, the ball best hit by the
          group will determine the location from where everybody will hit next,
          and so on. Only one ball, and thus one score,  counts per hole for
          each team and the team with the lowest total score for the round wins.

        <h5>Fun Facts About Golf!</h5>
      
        <ul>
        <li>Golf is the 10th most popular sport in the world with 450 million
        fans.</li>
        <li>The term golf originated from the Netherlands. The Dutch word
        for club is “kolve” or “kolf”. The Dutch likely introduced the word to
        the Scots through trading during the 14th until the 17th centuries. Due
        to linguistic differences, the Scottish dialect modified the
        pronunciation and the terms became “gouff” and “goff”. In the 16th
        century, the term became, simply, golf.</li>
        <li>The oldest known golf course in the world is The Old Course at St. Andrews in Fife, Scotland. 
        </li>
        <li> Golf may be an elite sport now but it was originally simply a game that
        shepherds played to pass the time. They hit rocks using sticks during
        breaks. </li>
        <li> In the past, a golf course may consist of 5 holes, 12, 15,
        23, and so on. By the time 1754 rolled around, St. Andrews’ course had
        12 holes. Golfers played 10 of these holes twice, which means that a
        round of golf at the time consisted of 22 holes.</li>
        <li> The first balls used in playing golf were made from leather balls stuffed with bird feathers.</li>
        <li> The first golf balls that were mass-manufactured were made from the sapodilla tree sap. The sap was heated and dried in a round mold.</li>
        <li>The first handicap system was invented by a woman, Issette Pearson in 1893. The system leveled the playing field and allowed golfers who had less experience to play. 
        It also allowed male and female players with mixed skills to compete.</li>
        <li> “Fore!” is a golfer’s way to warn other players about an errant ball. This is a warning to help prevent any injuries.</li>
        It is the shortened version of afore or before, which was an old Scottish warning that means “look out ahead”.</li>
        <li> The most expensive club ever sold ($181,000) is also the oldest verified club. The Long-Nosed Putter club was manufactured by Andrew Dickson and features his stamp.</li>
